### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Senior Odoo Developer with 6+ years of experience** crafting complex ERP solutions. Currently, I am pivoting my focus toward **Artificial Intelligence**, specifically **Agentic AI** and **Machine Learning**.

My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional business software and modern AI capabilities. I believe the future of ERP and other business software isn't just recording data, but having intelligent agents act on it.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Integrating Agentic AI into Odoo-based Ticket Support Systems.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced LLM function calling, Data Science pipelines, and Generative AI workflows.
- 🎓 **Research:** Working on Machine Learning implementations for academic research using Jupyter Notebooks.
